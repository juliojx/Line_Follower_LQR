# Line_Follower_LQR
Thesis project for obtaining my bachelor's degree in Physics.  
I designed a simple model of a line follower robot to be controlled by an LQR control.

## Hardware
The first step is building the hardware, as I wanted to follow some rules from official contests in robotics, I designed a robot that could be contained in a 20cmx20cm square. Below, you can see the diagram of the project and components.

## Simulation and obtaining the control constants
As the sensors bar has to be centered as the robot goes forward on the line, we can consider the central sensors as a punctual mass in an unidimensional space under the effect of a varying time force. Therefore, we can use the double integrator model, whose equations are given by:

Based on the Pontryagin principle we can solve a optimization problem (see http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/obc09-obc09_03Mar09.pdf for a detailed explanation about the Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle) by solving the algebraic Riccati equation:
